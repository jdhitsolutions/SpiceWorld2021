# PowerShell Scripting Patterns and Practices

PowerShell is all about automation. It doesn't matter if you want to automate the provisioning of a new Microsoft 365 account, create a Hyper-V virtual machine, or get system information. You will need to script and you will want to do it the right way. This repository contains material from my Spiceworld 2021 presentation.

The PowerShell script files contain demonstration code. These are not files to execute. Open the files in your scripting editor and review. Many of the files contain examples of poor PowerShell scripting followed by suggested improved versions. Hopefully, you can use these "better" versions as models for your own work.
